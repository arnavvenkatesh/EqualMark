# EqualMark ‚Äî Precision Division & Layout Visualizer

**EqualMark** is a minimal web-based tool that calculates and visualizes equally spaced divisions across any given length.  
It was built by me, inspired by a simple challenge faced while drawing accurate tables in a physics record book.

### ‚ú¶ Key Features
- Computes exact tick positions for any length and number of divisions  
- Supports units (cm, mm, inches, pixels)  
- Renders an interactive SVG scale with labeled ticks  
- Allows SVG download and print-ready output  
- Single-file frontend ‚Äî no installation, no dependencies  

### ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The app divides a given length \(L\) into \(n\) equal parts using \( s = L / n \),  
then generates tick coordinates \( t_k = k \times s \) and visualizes them on a scalable ruler interface.  
All rendering is done with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### üåê Live Demo
Once deployed, your site will be available at:

### üß≠ Motivation
EqualMark was created to make small-scale measurement and layout tasks simpler, bridging classroom accuracy with real-world engineering precision.
